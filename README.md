# NetflixRecomm_DSP

Netflix's recommendation system works by analyzing user behavior, such as viewing history and explicit feedback, along with content features like genre and metadata. It employs collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, matrix factorization, and deep learning to provide personalized recommendations. The system continuously evolves through A/B testing and considers temporal dynamics to adapt to changing user preferences.
